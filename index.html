                <h3 class="p2 extrap">About Gwen Stefani</h3>
                <p class="p1">Gwen Renée Stefani (born October 3, 1969) is an American musician. She is a co-founder, lead
                    vocalist, and the primary songwriter of the band No Doubt, whose singles include "Just a Girl",
                    "Spiderwebs", and "Don't Speak", from their 1995 breakthrough studio album Tragic Kingdom, as well as
                    "Hey Baby" and "It's My Life" from later albums.</p>
                <p class="p1">Her brother Eric introduced Gwen to 2 Tone music by Madness and the Selecter, and, in 1986, he
                invited her to provide vocals for No Doubt, a ska band he was forming.[15] In 1991, the band was signed to
                Interscope Records.[25] The band released its self-titled debut album in 1992, but its ska-pop sound was
                unsuccessful due to the popularity of grunge.[26] Before the mainstream success of both No Doubt and
                Sublime, Stefani contributed guest vocals to "Saw Red" on Sublime's 1994 album Robbin' the Hood. Stefani
                rejected the aggressiveness of female grunge artists and cited Blondie singer Debbie Harry's combination
                of power and sex appeal as a major influence.[27] No Doubt's third album, Tragic Kingdom (1995), which
                followed the self-released The Beacon Street Collection (1995), took more than three years to make. Five
                singles were released from Tragic Kingdom, including "Don't Speak", which led the Hot 100 Airplay
                year-end chart of 1997.[28] Stefani left college for one semester to tour for Tragic Kingdom but did not
                return when touring lasted two and a half years.[16] The album was nominated for a Grammy and sold more
                than 16 million copies worldwide by 2004.[16][29][30] In late 2000, Rolling Stone magazine named her
                "the Queen of Confessional Pop".[31]</p>
                <p class="p1">During the time when No Doubt was receiving mainstream success, Stefani collaborated on the
                singles "You're the Boss" with the Brian Setzer Orchestra, "South Side" with Moby, and "Let Me Blow Ya Mind"
                with Eve. No Doubt released the less popular Return of Saturn in 2000, which expanded upon the new wave
                influences of Tragic Kingdom.[32] Most of the lyrical content focused on Stefani's often rocky
                relationship with then-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and her insecurities, including indecision on
                settling down and having a child.[33] The band's 2001 album, Rock Steady, explored more reggae and
                dancehall sounds, while maintaining the band's new wave influences.[34] The album generated
                career-highest singles chart positions in the United States,[35] and "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All"
                received Grammy Awards. A greatest hits collection, The Singles 1992–2003, which includes a cover of
                Talk Talk's "It's My Life", was released in 2003. In 2002, Eve and Stefani won a Grammy Award for Best
                Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Let Me Blow Ya Mind".[36]</p>

                <h3 class="p2 extrap">Early Life</h3>
                <p class="p1">Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, in Fullerton, California, and raised Catholic in nearby
                    Anaheim,
                    California. She was named after a stewardess in the 1968 novel Airport, and her middle name, Renée,
                    comes from the Four Tops' 1968 version of the Left Banke's 1966 song "Walk Away Renée". Her father
                    Dennis Stefani is Italian-American and worked as a Yamaha marketing executive.[18] Her mother Patti (née
                    Flynn) is Irish-American and worked as an accountant before becoming a homemaker.
                    Stefani's parents were fans of folk music and exposed her to music by artists like Bob Dylan and Emmylou
                    Harris. Stefani has two younger siblings, Jill and Todd, and an older brother, Eric. Eric
                    was the keyboardist for No Doubt before leaving the band to pursue a career in animation on The
                    Simpsons.</p>
                <p class="p1">Stefani began wearing a bindi in the mid-1990s after attending several family gatherings with
                    Tony Kanal, who is of Indian heritage.[178] During No Doubt's breakthrough, Stefani wore the forehead decoration in
                    several of the band's music videos and briefly popularized the accessory in 1997.[179] Since the 1995
                    music video for "Just a Girl", Stefani has been known for her midriff and frequently wears tops that
                    expose it.[180] Stefani's makeup design generally includes light face powder, bright red lipstick, and
                    arched eyebrows; she wrote about the subject in a song titled "Magic's in the Makeup" for No Doubt's
                    Return of Saturn, asking "If the magic's in the makeup/Then who am I?".[16] Stefani is a natural
                    brunette, but her hair has not been its natural color since she was in ninth grade.[181] Since late
                    1994, she has usually had platinum blonde hair. Stefani discussed this in the song "Platinum Blonde
                    Life" on Rock Steady and played original blonde bombshell Jean Harlow in the 2004 biopic The
                    Aviator.[182] She dyed her hair blue in 1998[179] and pink in 1999,[183] when she appeared on the cover
                    of Return of Saturn with pink hair.[184]</p>
                <p class="p1">Throughout her career as a solo artist, Stefani has won several music awards, including one
                    Grammy Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, one American Music Award, one Brit Award, and two Billboard Music Awards.
                    With No Doubt, she has won two Grammy Awards. In 2005, Rolling Stone called her "the only true female
                    rock star left on radio or MTV" and featured her on the magazine's cover.[189] Stefani received the
                    Style Icon Award at the first People Magazine Awards in 2014.[190] In 2016, the singer was honored at
                    the Radio Disney Music Awards with a Hero Award, which is given to artists based on their personal
                    contributions to various charitable works.[191]</p>
